How to Change Nginx Ports Manually?


WARNING: Nginx ports must be same in database and nginx.conf file for each server.


Go to Manage Servers page and change ports of a server,

Then connect to your server with ssh client or winscp to 
modify nginx.conf files manually with a text editor.



There are 2 nginx.conf files,
- /home/xtreamcodes/iptv_xtream_codes/nginx/conf/nginx.conf
 -this one has http broadcast and admin panel server blocks
 
- /home/xtreamcodes/iptv_xtream_codes/nginx_rtmp/conf/nginx.conf 
 -this one has rtmp config.


Edit ports and save the config files.


Since R22B, you can change broadcasting ports from panel /Manage Servers / Edit Server / Advanced page.

And reload nginx config with this command.

sudo /home/xtreamcodes/iptv_xtream_codes/nginx/sbin/nginx -s reload

and

sudo /home/xtreamcodes/iptv_xtream_codes/nginx_rtmp/sbin/nginx_rtmp -s reload

Check the ports with,

sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN

it is done.
